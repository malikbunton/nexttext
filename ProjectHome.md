NextText is a Java library for building applications to display dynamic and interactive text-based applications. The library uses TrueType fonts to render text which moves and changes shape according to a set of rules. The programmer has full control over the text and the rules defining its behaviour.

[NextText for Processing](http://www.nexttext.net) is a port of the library for the [Processing](http://www.processing.org) development environment. Keeping in mind the goals of Processing, the library includes greatly simplified syntax and allows the creation of interesting sketches with very few lines of code. And for programmers who want to push the envelope further, all functionality of the [Java](http://java.sun.com) version of the library is maintained, so it is still possible to create intricate and more complex applications.
